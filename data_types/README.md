# Data types

Rust is a **statically typed** language, meaning, it must know the type of all variables at compile time.

**How to Define a Type in Rust?**

We can define a variable in rust in two different ways:

**Implicit Definition**

Unlike other languages like C++ and Java, Rust can infer the type from the type of value assigned to a variable at compile time.

```zsh

**Syntax**

The general syntax is:

## **Explicit Definition**

Explicitly tells the compiler about the type of variable being declared.

**Syntax**

The general syntax is:

## **Primitive Types**

Rust has a couple of types that are considered primitive. That means they are built-in to the language. There are different data types used for different purposes.

The following illustration shows the different primitive data types in Rust:

### Scalar Type

They store a single value.

Below is the list of scalar types:

- Integers
- Floats
- Boolean
- Character

### Compound Type

They group multiple values in one variable. Below is the list of compound types:

- Array
- Tuple
