# rustgrow
Small exercises to get you up to speed on the ðŸ¦€ Rust programming language.

## Introduction
- Rust developed by Graydon Hoare. Mozilla Labs later acquired the programme.
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) is a low-level statically-typed multi-paradigm programming language thatâ€™s focused on safety and performance.
- Rust solves problems that C/C++ has been struggling with for a long time, such as memory errors and building concurrent programs.
- Rust can be used to write high-level programs down to hardware-specific programs.

Rust focuses on three goals:
- Safety
- Speed
- Concurrency

## Getting started
Steps that you need to follow to setup your development environment in order to start working with Rust:

- To install Rust visit the official [website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and then download the latest version of Rust.
- To install VSCode visit the official [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and then download the latest version of VSCode.

The [Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) allows you to experiment with Rust before you install it locally, or in any other case where you might not have the compiler available.

The exercises are sorted by topic and can be found in the `directory`. For every topic there is an additional **README** file with some resources to get you started on the topic. We really recommend that you have a look at them before you start.
